\section{Personal History}

My name is Adil Khan. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from SJSU. Previously, I have done my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from Pune University. Through my academic coursework and professional career, I have gained expertise in diverse fields of Computer Science such as DevOps, Android Development, Machine learning and Big Data. So Iâ€™m very flexible with learning new technologies and implementing solutions.
I'd really describe myself as a person with a versatile skill-set, a lot of integrity and a willingness to go the extra mile to get the desired solution.

\begin{enumerate}
\item To move into a position of responsibility and build a cloud deployment pipeline for a company.
\item To secure good grades in this course.
\item To work on an interesting project to show on my Resume.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Topics of Interest}
As mentioned in Section ~\ref{sec:one},I have strong interests in the field of cloud deployment, DevOps and machine learning. 
As a research topic, I would love to explore about possibilities of using Machine learning to improve Cloud infrastructure.
I have found this paper ~\cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/GulmezogluES17} and this paper ~\cite{DBLP:conf/cscloud/SalmanBEJS17} for the same.
